# URL Shortener

## ðŸ›  **WIP**

This is/will be a URL shortener built in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). I wanted
to experiment with AWS' free tier, so I'll be using
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) (serverless) as a backend. I'm
assuming it'll be easiest to use a Amazon-hosted database with Lambda so I'll
probably use [Dynamodb](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) as it looks somewhat
promising.

## Features (possibly)

- [ ] Intuitive UI
- [ ] Convert URL to `{domain}/[a-zA-Z]{6}`
- [ ] URL analytics
- [ ] Account system
- [ ] Pay for custom URL ([Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/js)?)
